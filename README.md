## Description

This custom module changes the default position of the watermark image. This can be altered to you needs with simple edits to the MyImageFactory code.
webtrees 2.2 has improved the way images and watermarks are scaled. Watermarks now scale to fit the image size. The position can be set to top, center or bottom.
To position watermarks left or right use white space in the watermark image to pad the text or symbol left or right.
This module was created with the generous input from Greg Roach [fisharebest](https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees).

<a name="requirements"></a>
## Requirements

This module requires **webtrees** version 2.2 or later.
This module has the same requirements as [webtrees#system-requirements](https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees#system-requirements).

This module was tested with **webtrees** 2.2.1 version and most available themes.

<a name="installation"></a>
## Installation

This section documents installation instructions for this module.

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/photon-flip/reposition-webtrees-watermark/releases).
2. Unzip the package into your `webtrees/modules_v4` directory of your web server.
3. Rename the folder to `webtrees-watermark`. It's safe to overwrite the respective directory if it already exists.

   and find the module `Watermark Module`. Check if it has a tick for "Enabled".

<a name="customization"></a>
## Customization

The default instalation contains default webtrees watermark image, some sample images and a Photshop PSD template image as a basis for your own personalization.
Simply modify and saveas with the file name 'watermark.png' of type .png
The position of the watermark can be changed with simple modifications to code in the 'webtrees/modules_v4/reposition-webtrees-watermark/MyWatermarkFactory.php'
On line 47 'return $image->place(element: $watermark, position: 'bottom');' change the position with key words: 'center' or 'top' or, 'bottom'


<a name="persistant cache"></a>
## Persistant Cache

The final watermarked images are single combined images and are stores in the webtrees data/cache.
After installing or updating the module or code, images can take some time to be used instead of those previously cached. 
This can be sped up by clearing the data/cache.
Go to: Control panel/Clean up data folder/cache and  click the bin icon.
Some images may also be stored for a time in the Browswer cache and this may also need to be cleared if required.


<a name="upgrade"></a>
## Upgrade

To update simply replace the `reposition-watermark-module`
files with the new ones from the latest release.
